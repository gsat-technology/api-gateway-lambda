# API Gateway / Lambda demo

Demonstrates a scripted setup of an API Gateway rest API which passes a configured GET request parameter to Lambda (which echoes back the event it receives).

Work in Progress
- this README needs more instructions including requirements, instructions (setup, create, teardown)
- use of jq in scripts could be replaced by AWS cli native --query option
